The Google Chart Tools offer interactive\ncharts which can be embedded into web pages. The best \nknown of these charts is probably the Motion Chart, popularised \nby Hans Rosling in his TED talks. \n \nThe functions of the googleVis package allow the user to visualise\ndata stored in R data frames with the Google Chart Tools\nwithout uploading the data to Google. The output of a `googleVis`\nfunction is html code that contains the data and references to\nJavaScript functions hosted by Google.\n  \ngoogleVis makes use of the internal R HTTP server to display the\noutput locally. A modern browser with an Internet connection is\nrequired and for some charts Flash.\n\n# Introduction\n\n## Motivation\n\nMore and more data is becoming available, and yet\nstories and insights are still often missed: we are lost in the data\njungle and struggle to see the wood for the trees. \n\nHence, new tools are required to bring data to life, to engage with\nusers, to enable them to slice and dice the data, to view it from\nvarious angles and to find stories worth telling: outliers, trends or\neven the obvious. \n\nIn 2006 Hans Rosling gave an inspiring talk at\nTED `r citep(bib[\"HansRoslingTedTalk\"])` about social and economic developments\nin the world over the past 50 years, which challenged the views and\nperceptions of many listeners. Rosling had used extensive data analysis\nto reach his conclusions.  To visualise his talk, he and his team at\nGapminder `r citep(bib[\"Gapminder\"])` had developed animated bubble charts, aka\nmotion charts. \n\nRosling's presentation popularised the idea and use of interactive\ncharts. One year later the software behind\nGapminder was bought by Google and integrated as motion charts into\ntheir Google Chart Tools `r citep(bib[\"GoogleVisApi\"])`, formerly known as Google\nVisualisation API.  \n\nIn 2010 Sebastian Perez Saaibi `r citep(bib[\"Saaibi2010\"])` presented at the \nR/Rmetrics Workshop on  Computational Finance and Financial\nEngineering, the idea to use Google motion charts to visualise R\noutput with the R.rsp package `r citep(bib[\"Rsp\"])`. \n\nInspired by those talks and the desire to use interactive data\nvisualisation tools to foster the dialogue between data analysts and\nothers the authors of this vignette started the development of the\n`googleVis` package `r citep(bib[\"googleVis\"])`,\n`r citep(bib[\"RJournal:2011-2:GesmannCastillo\"])` in August 2010. \n\n![Overview of a Google Motion Chart](./figures/MotionChart.png)\n\n*Overview of a Google Motion Chart.  Screenshot of the output of\n`plot(gvisMotionChart(Fruits, idvar='Fruit', timevar='Year'))`*\n\n\n## Motion Chart Example\n\nFollowing the documentation of the Google Motion Chart API we need a\ndata set which has at least four columns: one identifying the\nvariable we would like to plot, one time variable and at least two\nnumerical variables, further numerical and character columns are allowed.\n\nAs an example we use the `Fruits` data set:\n\n```{r Fruits}\ndata(Fruits)\nFruits\n```\n\nHere we will use the columns `Fruit` and\n`'Year'` as id and time variable respectively. However we could\nhave used `'Date'` instead of `'Year'` as well. \n\n\n```{r motionchartfruits, results='asis'}\n M <- gvisMotionChart(Fruits, idvar=\"Fruit\", timevar=\"Year\")\nplot(M)\n```\n\n<iframe src=\"http://mages.github.io/googleVis/WorldBank.html\"\n frameborder=\"0\" width=\"700px\" height=\"1800px\">Loading</iframe>\n\n# References\n\n```{r bibliography, results='asis', echo=FALSE}\nbibliography(bulleted=FALSE)\n```\n",
