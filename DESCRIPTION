Description: The googleVis package provides an interface between R
    and the Google Charts API. It allows users to create web pages
    with interactive charts based on R data frames and to display
    them locally using the R HTTP help server without uploading
    the data to Google. A modern browser with Internet connection is
    required and for some charts Flash.
